I started my journey by creating small but convenient solutions, from scripts for friends to full—fledged applications like the PDF Diary (180+ visitors per day). I appreciate when development makes life easier, so I always look at the product through the eyes of the user.


What fascinates me:
-> Analysis and optimization — I understand other people's code, APIs, and even mobile applications (sometimes I decompile APKs for fun) in order to find unobvious improvements.
-> Server experiments — I set up a home server, host projects, try Docker (and even wrote my own containers).
-> Fix minor but annoying bugs — if something can be made more convenient, why not try it?

Technical background:
— Frontend: Vue 3, React/Next.js, Tailwind
— Backend: Node.js (Bun), Laravel (PHP), REST API
— Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL
— Desktop: C# (WPF, MAUI)
— Experience with Modbus, Figma, Git, Linux


P.S. In my free time, I like to analyze new technologies — just because it's interesting :)
